## Packages
| Package | Description | PDF | Webpage |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Rcmdr | R Commander: A platform-independent basic-statistics GUI (graphical user interface) for R, based on the tcltk package. | [Rcmdr.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/Rcmdr.pdf) | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html |
| rriskDistributions | Collection of functions for fitting distributions to given data or by known quantiles. Two main functions fit.perc() and fit.cont() provide users a GUI that allows to choose a most appropriate distribution without any knowledge of the R syntax. Note, this package is a part of the 'rrisk' project | [rriskDistributions.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rriskDistributions/rriskDistributions.pdf) | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rriskDistributions/index.html |
| MASS | Support Functions and Datasets for Venables and Ripley's MASS | [	MASS.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/MASS.pdf) | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html |
| survival | Contains the core survival analysis routines, including definition of Surv objects, Kaplan-Meier and Aalen-Johansen (multi-state) curves, Cox models, and parametric accelerated failure time models. | [survival.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/survival.pdf) | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html |
| fitdistrplus | Extends the fitdistr() function (of the MASS package) with several functions to help the fit of a parametric distribution to non-censored or censored data. Censored data may contain left censored, right censored and interval censored values, with several lower and upper bounds. In addition to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the package provides moment matching (MME), quantile matching (QME), maximum goodness-of-fit estimation (MGE) and maximum spacing estimation (MSE) methods (available only for non-censored data). Weighted versions of MLE, MME, QME and MSE are available. See e.g. Casella & Berger (2002), Statistical inference, Pacific Grove, for a general introduction to parametric estimation. | [fitdistrplus.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/fitdistrplus.pdf) | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fitdistrplus/index.html |
| tidyr | Tools to help to create tidy data, where each column is a variable, each row is an observation, and each cell contains a single value. 'tidyr' contains tools for changing the shape (pivoting) and hierarchy (nesting and 'unnesting') of a dataset, turning deeply nested lists into rectangular data frames ('rectangling'), and extracting values out of string columns. It also includes tools for working with missing values (both implicit and explicit). | [tidyr.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/tidyr.pdf) | https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/index.html |
